atheme (irc services)

Atheme is one of the major versions of irc services for irc networks providing
things like NickServ and ChanServ.

You can enable a few optional features by passing variables to the script
(VAR=yes ./atheme.SlackBuild):
  LARGENET=yes|no (Builds atheme specifically tailored to large networks)
  CONTRIB=yes|no (Builds some contrib modules)
  PERL=yes|no (Builds atheme's perl api)
  PCRE=yes|no (Allow PCRE regexes to be used)

All these default to no.

Before starting `atheme-services` you will need to create a configuration file
named `/etc/atheme/atheme.conf`. In that directory there are several example
configuration files you can make use of.
